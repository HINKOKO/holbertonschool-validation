# **Testing in the Software Development Methodology**

## **Learnings Go-als**

- Understand what linting is the extent of its usages (which kind of file can be linted, and the impact of running it often)
- Understand the difference between unit tests and integration tests
- Use code coverage as a helper to write tests
- Understand that not only “classical” code is to be tested, but also a lot of the artifacts we can generate
- Understand how “component”-based testing for acceptance and end to end validation is to be used

# **Makefile \_\_ Targets\***
